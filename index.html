          <p>Hello! My name is Harsh. I was born in India and moved to America in 2002. Since then Iâ€™ve lived in Northeast Philadelphia. I did my Undergraduate at Temple University and loved all the ups and downs during my stay there. The tough times taught me that nothing in this world is easy and that I should not take anything for granted.</p>
          <p>I value my family and friends, without them I would not be the person I am today. They constantly push me to my limits and they helped mold me into what I am today. I look at the sacrifices my parents have made and use that as a fuel to fire my success.</p>
